# Lesson 2

## Agenda

1. Definition
2. The ledger evolution
3. Reasons and motivations
4. A star is born. History of Blockchain
5. Blockchain technological ancestors

## Definition

The name Blockchain it has been coined by
Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym?)
Paper - Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008)
New electronic payment system that relies on cryptography

Where it was defined as "a chain of blocks with each block containing a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data"

Purpose: to serve as a decentralized ledger for recording transactions and maintaining consensus in a trustless environment

## Trade Ledger

A ledger it came from far far away, in a ledger you can take a register of transactions

## Accounting Evolution

Double-entry bookkeeping system described in the book by Luca Pacioli originated from the possible influence of the practice of Muslim accounting, practiced and implemented by the Venetians (Zaid, O.A. 2000)

## Evolution of ledgers and systems

"The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value" Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)

a. Centrilised ledger (All information in only one person)
b. Decentralised ledger (Cross information in few nodes)
c. Distributed ledger (Blockchain, all information in each node)

## Decentralised ledgers

A descentralised ledger refers to a ledger that is maintained and updated by multiple parties without the need for a central authority

### Strengths of Decentralized Ledgers:

1. Decentralisation leads to increased security, as there is no central point of failure that can be targeted by hackers.
2. Decentralised ledgers offer more transparency and accountability, as all parties on the network can see and verify transactions.
3. Decentralised ledgers allow for the creation of trustless environments, as there is no need for intermediaries to verify transactions.

### Weaknesses of Decentralized Ledgers:

1. Decentralised ledgers can be slow, as they require consensus among multiple parties before a transaction can be proceessed.
2. Decentralised ledgers can be difficult to implement, as they require coordination and agreement among multiple parties.
3. Decentralised ledgers can be expensives, as they require large amounts of computing power and energy to maintain the network.

## Distributed Ledgers

A distributed ledger, on the other hand, refers to a ledger that is maintained and updated by multiple parties and is stored in multiple locations.

### Strengths of Distributed Ledgers:

1. Distributed ledgers can be faster than decentralized ledgers, as they can process transactions in parallel.
2. Distributed ledgers can be more scalable than decentralized ledgers, as they can be expanded to accommodate more users and transactions.
3. Distributed ledgers can be more flexible than decentralized ledgers, as they can be customized to meet specific needs.

### Weaknesses of Distributed Ledgers:

1. Distributed ledgers can be less secure than decentralized ledgers, as there is a central point of control that can be targeted by hackers.
2. Distributed ledgers can be less transparent and accountable than decentralized ledgers, as some parties on the network may have more control over the ledger than others.
3. Distributed ledgers can be more complex and difficult to manage than decentralized ledgers, as they require coordination and agreement among multiple parties and multiple copies of the ledger.

## A Global blockchain

Many nodes contriuting to the network computing effort and data persistency capabilities.

**_Shared responsibilites are required_**

## It is all about Trust

### Institutional trust

> Closed
> Centralized
> Top-down

### Distributed trust

> Open
> Decentralized
> Bottom-up

## Not just a technical decision

**_Plato's_** theory of an ideal society, as outlined in his Replublic, advocated for a strong central goverment, with individuals placed into different castes based on their abilities.

**_Aristotle_**, on the other hand, believed in a more decentralized approach to governance, advocating for a constitutional government with defined and limited powers.

**_Jean-Jacques Rousseau_** wrote in his work, "The Social Contract" that the people should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives and that the power of the state should be limited.

**_Thomas Hobbes_** believed in the idea of strong central authority, where a single ruler held all the power to maintain order and ensure the protection of its citizens.

**_Friedrich Hayek_** discussed the concept of decentralization in his work "The use of Knowledge in Society" He argued that decentralized systems, such a free markets, allow for the efficient allocation of resources because individuals have access to local knowledge and can make decisions based on that information.

## Real case of institutional failure

Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 15, 2008.

## February 11, 2009. decentralized, non-trust-based system

### Satoshi Nakamoto with BITCOIN

## How did we get there?

1. Arpanet 1969 (Was the origin of the internet, the first nodes interconnected by the department of defense in USA)
2. CRYPTOGRAPHY 1970-1978 (Public Keys cryptography and network security, cryptographic hash functions)
3. Invention of MERKLE TREES 1979 (hashes in a tree)
4. TCP/IP development 1980
5. Byzantine general problems 1982
6. Pricing via processing Combatting junk email (PoW initiation) 1992
7. Tamper proofing document timestamp with Merkle Trees 1983
8. Digicah 1995
9. Bitgold (hash chaining byzantine Quorums) 1998
10. P2P networks (Napster but with a central node for indexing) 1999
11. Then Gnutella to achieve decentralization 2000
12. BitTorrent with the distributed hash tables 2001
13. Hashcash 2002
14. B-Money 2004
15. BITCOIN - Blockchain 2009
