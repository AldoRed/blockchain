# Lesson 1

## Expected Learning outcomes

- Technical and implementation aspects of blockchain network setup and smart contracts and then lead students to dive into developing their own smart contract apps
- Throught the course, students will engage in hands-on exercises and projects to develop their skills in coding, installing blockchain, and developing smart contracts using Solidity
- Students will explore innovate and disruptive applications of the blockchain technologies by developing their own mini block-chain products.

## Some core topics we will cover but not limited are:

- development frameworks, Ethereum client APIs, etc.
- deploying a blockchain node
- smart contract languages
- smart contract anatomy
- smart contracts libraries
- smart contract security
- compiling smart contracts
- deploying smart contracts
- testing smart contracts
- composability
